[AutonomySim](https://github.com/nervosys/AutonomySim) was created by [Adam Erickson](https://github.com/admercs) at [Nervosys](https://nervosys.ai/) in July 2023 as a fork of [an updated version](https://github.com/CodexLabsLLC/Colosseum) of Microsoft [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim), deprecated by Microsoft in 2017 in favor of its [Azure cloud services](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/autonomous-systems-project-airsim). AutonomySim is a large-scale project reorganization and modernization effort. This effort includes adding artificial intelligence (AI) modeling capabilities, migrating to Unreal Engine 5.3, dropping support for Unity, Gazebo, and ROS1, switching from Command/Batch files to PowerShell on Windows, as well as cleaning up the directory structure, filenames, and code.

AirSim was originally created in 2016 by [Shital Shah](https://github.com/sytelus) at Microsoft. Shital authored the physics engine, multirotor model, car model, environment models, sensor models, all Unreal Engine related code, APIs, SimpleFlight firmware, computer vision components, documentation, *et cetera*.

[Chris Lovett](https://github.com/lovettchris) at Microsoft, another original author, contributed the MavLink library, PX4-related components, the Settings system, build system, several important bug fixes, *et cetera*.

[Alon Faraj](https://github.com/alonfaraj) and [Tyler Fedrizzi](https://github.com/xxEoD2242) at Codex Labs contributed [a series of updates](https://github.com/microsoft/AutomataSim/compare/main...CodexLabsLLC:Colosseum:main) in 2022-2023, including patches to support Unreal Engine 5.
