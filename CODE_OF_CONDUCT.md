# Code of Conduct

### Version

1.0

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, leaders, and developer advocates, pledge
to act in a manner that makes participation in our community as enjoyable
and productive as possible for everyone.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to a positive,
productive, free, and open community.
We pledge to treat the contributions of everyone the same regardless
of identity, judged only by their merits.
We pledge not to infringe upon the rights of others, including the
freedoms of speech, religion, and political affiliation, *inter alia*.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive and productive environment include:

* Encouraging and publicly celebrating the accomplishments of others
* Demonstrating patience, empathy, and kindness toward others
* Being respectful regardless of differences of opinion, viewpoint, or experience
* Rapidly delivering and receiving constructive feedback for timely improvement
* Accepting responsibility, apologizing for mistakes when appropriate, and adapting
  behaviour
* Focusing on how our interests are best aligned with those of the community

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a negative and unproductive environment include:

* Trolling, insulting, name-calling, or other derogatory comments
* Attacking other members based on their identity, including their views
* Public or private harassment, including unwanted sexual attention or advances
* Publishing the private information of others without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
  setting

## Scope

This *Code of Conduct* applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the official
Discord site of Botnix.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
Community leaders will treat others as innocent until proven guilty.
In the case of unclear or weak evidence that is insufficient to make a
well-supported decision, enforcement shall default to no disciplinary action.
Enforcement shall not be arbitrary or capricious nor take identity into account.
Community leaders shall apply the same standards to everyone without bias or
prejudice.

### Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these *Community Impact Guidelines* in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this *Code of Conduct*:

1. Warning: First

    * Impact: Unprofessional behaviour in violation of the *Community Standards*.
    * Consequence: A private written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate.

1. Warning: Second

    * Impact: Continued unprofessional behaviour in violation of the *Community
Standards* despite previous warnings.
    * Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the *Code of Conduct*, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

1. Temporary Ban

    * Impact: A serious violation of the *Community Standards*, including
sustained inappropriate behaviour.
    * Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the *Code of Conduct*, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

1. Permanent Ban

    * Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of *Community
Standards*, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of others based on identity.
    * Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.
Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this *Code of Conduct*, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
