# How to Create Issue or Ask Questions Effectively

`AutonomySim` is an open-source project. Contributors like you keep it going. It is important to respect contributors' time and effort when asking a question or filing an issue. Your chances of receiving helpful response will likely improve by following the below guidelines.

## Good Practices

* [Search issues](https://github.com/nervosys/AutonomySim/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if someone already has asked it.
* Chose title that is short and summarizes well. 
* Copy and paste full error message.
* Precisely describe steps you used that produced the error message or symptom.
* Describe what vehicle, mode, OS, AutonomySim version and other settings you are using.
* Copy and paste minimal version of code that reproduces the problem.
* Tell us what the goal you want to achieve or expected output.
* Tell us what you did so far to debug this issue.

## Bad Practices

* Do not use "Please help" etc in the title. See above.
* Do not copy and paste screen shot of error message. Copy and paste text.
* Do not use "it doesn't work". Precisely state what is the error message or symptom.
* Do not ask to write code for you. [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)!
